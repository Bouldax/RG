# Rhythm Man version 1.0

Rhythm Man (working title) is a rhythm-based side-scrolling set in the late 1900â€™s and is heavily influenced by Mega Man and modern-day hi-bit pixel art. The main character, Rhythm Man, will face a number of bosses after traversing linear levels that lead up to them. Each boss will revolve around a different instrument from a keytar, electric bass, synthesizer, and many more. After defeating a boss, Rhythm Man will be able to use the instrument obtained from said boss in future levels to tackle enemies in a new way.
